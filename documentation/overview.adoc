== Overview of DeltaSpike
Apache DeltaSpike supports the development of portable CDI extensions that provide useful features for Java applications that are not provided out-of-the-box by the CDI specification (this includes security and JPA). CDI extensions created by the DeltaSpike community are packaged as modules.

Apache DeltaSpike is a toolbox for CDI.

The goal of Apache DeltaSpike is to provide useful classes to:

* boot CDI containers (Weld, OpenWebbeans, OpenEJB) for Java SE
* stage projects
* provide new scopes (Window Scope, for instance)
* manage messages and configurations
